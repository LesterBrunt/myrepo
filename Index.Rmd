### Introduction

The two files contain Balinese Gamelan in a contemporary style of Gong Kebyar. I made it in Ableton Live with sampled gamelan instruments (https://baligamelansamples.bandcamp.com/album/gong-kebyar-balinese-gamelan-sample-pack) and I recorded myself playing the suling (bamboo flute). It is a work in progress and has no title as of yet. The piece's full length is currently 13 minutes. The uploaded files contain the middle two sections of the piece.
